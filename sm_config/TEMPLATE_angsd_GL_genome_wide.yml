## Pipeline setup ##
####################

# Reference genome
# The pipeline assumes that, in the same folder as the reference genome file, there is a genome index file
# with the same filename and an appended .fai suffix.
# See http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html
ref_genome: /path/to/reference/genome.fa

# Bamlist file giving samples to calculate GLs for.
# Simple text file, with one .bam file per line
# Bamlist should give the absolute path to the bamfiles, from the root. 
bamlist: /path/tp/bamlist.txt


# Batch name
# A short name to give for a given analysis batch.
# E.g., to be able to calculate GLs for the same bamlist
# but with different filtering levels
batch_name: descriptive_batch_name

# Number of CPUs to use
cpus: 16

# Gather or not
# Should the per-scaffold GL files be gathered into a single file?
# Must be True or False
gather: False

# Test or not
# if True, will calculate GLs for the 3 smallest scaffolds
# as a test, and will not combine the GLs for each scaffold
# into a final genome-wide file 
# if False, does all scaffolds and then combines them.
# Must be True or False. 
test: False

## ANGSD filtering options ##
#############################
# Decribed below, see ANGSD manual for further detail
SNP_pval: 1e-6 # Only keep sites if prob that it is a SNp is less than. 
minMapQ: 20 # Discard reads with mapping quality below
minQ: 20 # Discard bases with base quality below
uniqueOnly: 0 # Discards reads that doesn't map uniquely. Must be 1 (discard) or 0 (keep).
remove_bads: 1 # Discard 'bad' reads. Must be 1 (discard) or 0 (keep).
only_proper_pairs: 1  # Only use reads where the mate could be mapped. Must be 1 (only use proper), or 0 (use all reads)
trim: 0 # Number of based to discard at both ends of the reads
C: 50 # adjust mapQ for excessive mismatches. If you used BWA and didn't already adjust mapQ in samtools, do 50. Otherwise, 0. 
baq: 1 # Recalculate Base Alignment quality. Must be 1 (to recalculate), or 0 (no recalculate). A little unclear how this interacts with the GATK indel Realigner. I tend to re-calculate. 
minInd: 96 # Only use site if atleast minInd of samples has data
setMinDepth: 96 # Remove site if total depth (all individuals) is less than int. -1 for no filtering.
setMaxDepth: 1920 # Remove site if total depth (all individuals) is greater than int. -1 for no filtering.
setMinDepthInd: -1 # Remove individual from analysis at a given site if individual depth is less than int. -1 for no filtering.
setMaxDepthInd: 50 # Remove individual from analysis at a given site if individual depth is greater than int. -1 for no filtering.
