# Template config file for:
# pcangsd_thin_and_PCA.smk
# Takes a set of input GL files
# from ANGSD with -doGlf 2
# thins them, combined them,
# and runs a genome-wide PCA
###

# Reference genome
# The pipeline assumes that, in the same folder as the reference genome file, there is a genome index file
# with the same filename and an appended .fai suffix.
# See http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html
ref_genome: /path/to/reference/genome.fa

# Bamlists giving the list of files that went into the
# calculation of the GLs for the .saf index files for each population
# Bamlist should give the absolute path to the bamfiles, from the root. 
bamlist: /path/to/bamlist.txt

# Batch name
# A short name to give for a given analysis batch.
# the batch for the GL files should match the batch name used when
# generatiing the GLs
# The batch name for the PCA should be new and unique to the analysis set
batch_name_GL: batch_name_from_GLs
batch_name_PCA: PCA_batch_name

# The path to the location of the pcangsd.py script
# Include the full path to the pcangsd.py file, not just to the directory containing it. 
path_to_pcangsd: "~/bin/pcangsd.py"

# Thinning interval
# minimum number of bp required between SNPs
thin_interval: 10000

# Number of CPUs to use
# for individual jobs.
